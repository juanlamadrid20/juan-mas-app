# Dashboards

I have a Databricks App created from the Dash ChatBot template. Can you modify my App such that embeds multiple dashboards with the following requirements:

Core Features:
- Tab-based navigation for 3-4 different dashboard views
- Responsive iframe embedding of Databricks dashboards
- Environment variable configuration for dashboard URLs
- Error handling for missing/invalid dashboard URLs
- Clean, professional UI using Dash and Bootstrap

Technical Implementation:
- Use iframe with `calc(100vh - 200px)` height and responsive width
- Environment variables in app.yaml for each dashboard URL
- Fallback UI when dashboard URLs aren't configured
- Loading states and error messages
- Mobile-responsive design

Configuration Example:
```yaml
env:
  - name: "DASHBOARD_1_URL"
    value: "https://e2-demo-field-eng.cloud.databricks.com/embed/dashboardsv3/01f0381be8cd15f9808fddb109ad7085"
  - name: "DASHBOARD_2_URL" 
    value: "https://e2-demo-field-eng.cloud.databricks.com/embed/dashboardsv3/01f01d37eef817568159de3c7b10c9e0"
```

Error Handling:
- Show setup instructions when URLs are missing
- Display retry options for failed dashboard loads
- Graceful handling of network issues

Pro Tip:
"The iframe should handle Databricks dashboard embedding properly with allow='fullscreen' attribute, proper CSP handling, and should gracefully handle dashboard loading delays. Include a loading spinner that appears while the dashboard is loading."

Provide complete app.py, app.yaml, and requirements.txt files.
