# Add Dashboards

I have a Databricks App created from the Dash ChatBot template. Can you modify my App such that embeds multiple dashboards with the following requirements:

Core Features:
- Tab-based navigation for 3-4 different dashboard views
- Responsive iframe embedding of Databricks dashboards
- Environment variable configuration for dashboard URLs
- Error handling for missing/invalid dashboard URLs
- Clean, professional UI using Dash and Bootstrap

Technical Implementation:
- Use iframe with `calc(100vh - 200px)` height and responsive width
- Environment variables in app.yaml for each dashboard URL
- Fallback UI when dashboard URLs aren't configured
- Loading states and error messages
- Mobile-responsive design

Configuration Example:
```yaml
env:
  - name: "DASHBOARD_1_URL"
    value: "https://e2-demo-field-eng.cloud.databricks.com/embed/dashboardsv3/01f0381be8cd15f9808fddb109ad7085"
  - name: "DASHBOARD_2_URL" 
    value: "https://e2-demo-field-eng.cloud.databricks.com/embed/dashboardsv3/01f01d37eef817568159de3c7b10c9e0"
```

Error Handling:
- Show setup instructions when URLs are missing
- Display retry options for failed dashboard loads
- Graceful handling of network issues

Pro Tip:
"The iframe should handle Databricks dashboard embedding properly with allow='fullscreen' attribute, proper CSP handling, and should gracefully handle dashboard loading delays. Include a loading spinner that appears while the dashboard is loading."

Provide complete app.py, app.yaml, and requirements.txt files.




# Add Multi Agent Supervisor


Augment my existing Databricks App with an AI chatbot interface which calls a Databricks Multi-Agent Supervisor endpoint. The supervisor orchestrates multiple specialized agents for comprehensive responses.

Core Chatbot Features:
- Clean chat interface with message history and user input
- Send button and Enter key support for message submission
- Clear chat functionality with confirmation
- Typing indicator while processing responses
- Auto-scrolling chat history
- Professional styling with an cohesive theme

Response Formatting:
- Parse and display structured content (tables, lists, paragraphs)
- Handle markdown-style formatting (**bold**, *italic*, bullet points)
- Convert table data into formatted Bootstrap tables
- Support for multi-paragraph responses with proper spacing
- Error handling for malformed responses

Databricks Integration:
- Call Databricks model serving endpoints using MLflow deployment client
- Support both Agent Framework and chat completion endpoint formats
- Handle authentication automatically in Databricks environment
- Configurable endpoint name via environment variables
- Robust error handling for endpoint connectivity issues

Technical Implementation:
- Use Dash framework with Bootstrap styling
- Store chat history in browser session
- Implement proper callback structure for real-time chat
- Include loading states and error messaging
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

Agent Framework Compatibility:
- Designed to work with Databricks multiagent supervisors
- Supports complex multi-agent orchestration responses
- Handles structured outputs from specialized agents
- Maintains conversation context across agent interactions

Configuration:
```yaml
env:
  - name: "SERVING_ENDPOINT"
    value: "mas-84eae27f-endpoint"
```

Include complete app.py with chat interface, model serving integration, response formatting, and proper error handling.
